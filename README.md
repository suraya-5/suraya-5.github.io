My Python Project: Sales Data Analysis

## Overview
This project analyzes a small sales dataset using Python. 
It calculates revenue for each order, summarizes revenue by product, customer, and month, and visualizes trends using simple text-based charts. 
The dataset features characters from anime as customers, which makes it fun while demonstrating real-world analysis concepts.

## Tools Used
- Python 3.x
- Lists and dictionaries for data storage and aggregation
- Loops and calculations for processing the data
- Text-based charts for visualization in the terminal

## Main Steps i took
1. **Calculate revenue per order**: Each orderâ€™s revenue is computed by multiplying units sold by unit price.  
2. **Compute total and average revenue**: Summarizes overall sales performance.  
3. **Aggregate revenue by product**: Helps identify which products generate the most revenue.  
4. **Aggregate revenue by customer**: Shows which customers contribute the most to total revenue.  
5. **Aggregate revenue by month**: Highlights sales trends over time.  
6. **Visualize with simple charts**: Text-based bar charts display revenue distribution for products and customers.

## Insights
- The project allows quick analysis of sales data without external libraries.  
- Helps understand customer contributions, product performance, and monthly trends.  
- Demonstrates ability to process structured data, use loops, dictionaries, and produce readable outputs.
